# Stability analysis of the Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev methods for DDE

Using these files it is possible to find stability regions of the Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev methods for ODE and DDE. 

### File description
The value of a function that depends on an argument in the past can be found using either linear interpolation, or using the value, that was found earlier.
Files for finding stability regions for different methods can be found at the following links:
